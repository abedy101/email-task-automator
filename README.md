Hi team,

Great work on wrapping up the June deliverables.

Looking ahead, here are a few important follow-ups:

* Please finalize and submit the Q3 marketing budget proposal to finance by Thursday noon.
* Someone needs to follow up with David (legal) about the updated NDA ‚Äî make sure it's reviewed before we onboard the new partners next week.
* Jenna, kindly schedule a customer success meeting with the Top 5 enterprise clients. Ideally by Monday afternoon.
* Update the client onboarding SOP to reflect the new refund policy, and circulate to the CX team.
* Can someone double-check the CRM to ensure Acme Corp's billing info is accurate? We've had some issues with duplicate entries.
* Lastly, prepare the slides for next Wednesday's investor meeting ‚Äî include growth metrics, churn reduction, and new market expansion plans.

Thanks,
Dave
